This is a file sharing system. It is provide a web page for user to select files he want to share.
Then system will bundle those files to a zip file and provide a link to download. And you can assign 
the time how long the link will be expired. If time is up, the system will delete the zip, and the 
link will be unavailable.

It uses Sinatra to build the service api. the client is just javascript to use the api to communicate
the server for select/package files.
